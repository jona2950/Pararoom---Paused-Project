*	--- A conscious method of approaching machine learning are association to morality-aptitude relation.
*	--- Finding a correlation of a word's family tree [(Which will continue to grow from itself learning these new word) given examples, through a pattern selected by programmer (yes/no.1-10)
*	---	Predictions can be made with english Agreement (Syntax/Grammatics). A basic programm to r un questions from the machines to produce a pattern.
*	- - Verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc. This will help the computer program (AI, Aion) to intercept broad understanding of the word context. 
*	- - Test would be accomplished by asking the machine of the definition and a relation to other words. interpret the understanding of itself. 
*	- - These patterns for self-learning much be achieved with the usage of Mathematical Statistics to reach a peak of wisdom not only knowledge.
